## Problem Definition

Crops play a vital role in human life, and their growth and sustainability are crucial in the long run. Rice, especially, is a key agricultural crop; however, it often suffers from various diseases, leading to decreased yields and, in severe cases, crop failure. Diseases significantly impact rice growth and yield, resulting in economic losses and food security challenges. Image recognition plays a critical role in identifying rice diseases, facilitating automated and efficient detection, essential for effective management, ensuring food security, and promoting sustainable agriculture.

## Project Overview

This project aims to revolutionize rice disease detection in agriculture by leveraging Computer Vision and AI technologies. Through the development of the PSO-CNN model and its adaptation for mobile devices using TensorFlow Lite, we strive to address the complex challenges posed by rice diseases, ultimately contributing to sustainable agriculture practices, and ensuring food security.

## Project Objectives

The objective of this project is to develop a robust application that can accurately detect various rice diseases. The main objectives include:

1. Developing a deep learning model using PSO-CNN for accurate disease detection.
2. Saving the complex deep learning models using TensorFlow Lite for mobile deployment.
3. Developing a user-friendly mobile application for rice disease detection.

## Dataset

The Rice Leaf Diseases Detection dataset from kaggle is used for this project, which contains a total of 3829 images, with each class containing approximately 600-plus images. The dataset includes the following disease classes: Bacterial Leaf Blight, Brown Spot, Healthy Rice Leaf, Leaf Blast, Leaf scald, and Sheath Blight.

## Codebase
Includes two files:

1. `PSO_CNN Best Hyperparameter search.ipynb`: Run this notebook first to perform a hyperparameter search using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

2. `CNN_Best_Hyperparameters.ipynb`: After running the first notebook and obtaining the best hyperparameters, use this notebook to train the CNN model with the best hyperparameters.

Ensure all dependencies are installed before running the notebooks.
